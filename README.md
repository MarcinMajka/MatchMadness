# Match Madness - Japanese Kanji Learning Game
Match Madness is a web-based game inspired by Duolingo's Match Madness game mode, designed to facilitate learning Japanese Kanji in a fun and interactive manner. It allows players to match Kanji characters with their readings by connecting them in pairs.

# Features
Two columns of Kanji characters and their readings.
Connect matching Kanji-reading pairs to see the glossary.

# Future Plans
- Words Madness Mode: Implement a new game mode where a single Kanji character is displayed, and users input its meaning. Points are earned for correct translations.
- Customization Options: Allow users to customize game settings, number of Kanji characters displayed, favourite words for review etc.

# Motivation
The project originated from the need for a more engaging and interactive approach to learning Japanese Kanji. Traditional methods often involve rote memorization, which can be tedious and discouraging. Match Madness aims to provide a gamified learning experience that promotes repeated exposure to Kanji characters in a playful manner.
